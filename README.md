# nlp-sentiment-analysis-python
Leveraging NLP to do sentiment analysis in Python

Using NLP and Python libraries, measure the satisfaction from the data collected from a google survey. The background about the project is published in my Medium blog. 

Leveraged pandas data frame to read the CSV file and to do data transformations (Adding columns, measuring correlation etc.)
Used the NLTK - FreqDist and NLTK Word tokenize to count the most frequent words used in various survey questions 
Used matplotlib.pyplot to draw histograms, bar charts for various satisfaction metrics
Used regular expressions (re) and Lambda to cleanse the data and to do transformations
Used TextBlob to measure the sentiment (positive or negative) using Polarity and measured subjectivity using subjectivity
Used WorldCloud to generate the WordClouds for unstructured data
Used seaborn library to plot heat map for correlation matrix, bar plot
